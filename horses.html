      <p>We are a non-profit organization that helps out the BLM which does not stand for Black Lives Matter in this cause. We help out the Burro of Land Management, for finding new homes for wild Mustangs.</p>

<p>This website will direct you to many questions you might have on adopting a wild mustang.</p>

      <p>Ensure you meet the standard requirements for adopting or purchasing a wild horse or burro. You can find requirements in the Important Documents section of this webpage. Visit our Sales Program page for information on the process to purchase a sale-eligible wild horse or burro. </p>

      <p>Contact your preferred off-range corral location or make plans to visit an upcoming off-site adoption event near you. Each facility may have additional requirements beyond what is stated in the application; it is recommended that you contact your preferred corral and visit the facilityâ€™s website for more information. The BLM also hosts periodic adoption/sale opportunities on the Online Corral.</p>
