<h4>HARDCORE</h4>
  <div class="box">
    <p>HARDCORE is the second website #2 which is a great source to use for a high-quality, durable, and affordable waterfowl hunting products. This website has many images that apply to its website and make it intriguing to the customer. They have a great website that when you by a product from them you can buy now, hunt now, and pay later. You can set up a payment plan to pay for what you got overtime so its not all at once. Each menu page option gives a very appealing image to relate to what that section opens to be. They sell things from decoys, hunting apparel, and accessories. They also have waterfowl hunting equipment for your dogs as well.</p>
<p>This site is very well organized and as a great source that is easily assessable to everyone trying to assess it. The design and layout are on point, and I love the free shipping on orders $199+ with the little duck emojis next to it. This really displays what their company is about. They are running an HTML code for their website, and they have a CSS section too for their fonts and other design features as well. The coding is very clean and modern coding.</p>
<p>There is CSS effects on this page have a lot of coding involved but it really helps with the design of their website and brings everything together. They made their website appealing to duck hunters and duck hunters that have dogs as well. Their theme is very well, and they have a simple but clean company name.
