<h4>Favorite State Website:</h4>
<a>Maryland is defentiftley my favorite website out of all of the state Websites </a>
<p>Do you like the colors and design? I love the colors and the design of the website it is very eye-cacthing and brings in bright colors and pictures. The layout of the website is very user friendly and it also can be used on a moble phone as well. It has easy links to click on and could be easy for any cusomer to use. The website loads very quickly and doesnt take a long time at all to load anything. The header is very clean looking too and has good text that is not hard to read. By far this is the easiest website to navigate.</p>
