      <h1>Mission Statement</h1>
      <p></p>

      <p>I thought of the idea because we need people to help our veterans get acclimated into our world after active duty. This can help clients suffering from PTSD and other emotional problems going on in their lives from assisted therapy. Like most of us know from learning from a friend who is out of war or from the story on American Sniper we can see veterans need the support from us to help out.</p>

<p>Horses and Heroes will be selling to those who are veterans, military personnel, and other clients that need rehab therapy for their horses and need a farrier.</p>
<p>They will buy it because it has been proven that animals help veterans in their daily lives after being in war. Equine work is bonding with the animals on the property and gives them a friend in their lives in troubled times. We support our military and their needs. We focus on each client who walks in through our doors.</p>
<p>As long as we have lower costs we will have more clients which means more people we are helping out which we care the most about.</p>
	<p>We will be competing against many organizations that help veterans out but we offer more than just veterans but all military people that are still in duty.</p>
