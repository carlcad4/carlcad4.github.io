<h4>Least Favorite Website:</h4>
<a>Kansas is my least favorite website</a>
<p>I think the colors and design is very cool but not for a state website because it makes it hard to use. They have a search menu bar to find what you are looking for. The website loads very slowly as well and you can't really naviaget it well at all. You can find iteams on the website but it is just challeneging. You can view this website as a mobile view and you can use it on a larger screen as well.</p>
