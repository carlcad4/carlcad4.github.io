  <h4>Blue State:</h4>
  <a>Maine</a>
  <p>The colors of the Maine State website is very plane and the design though is nice. I think it has somewhat of an eye-pleasing though cause of the design of the website makes it easy to use. The website actually does load quickly, and the menu is
    easy to navigate on the website. I can fine iteams easily on the website. Yes, I can find what Im looking for on this website. This website does work on many different kinds of screens, they have it begining able to use on the moble phone as
    well.</p>
