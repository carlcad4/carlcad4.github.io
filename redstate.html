<h4>Red State:</h4>
<a>Alaska is the Red State because its on the polictics and shows that Alska is red.</a>
<p>I think the colors of this website is very plan and boring, their is no drawing into the cunsumer. It is not eye appealing and it also is not phone friendly. The website loads pretty quickly, and the website is very easy to navigate though. On this website you can find what you are looking for without hassle. It is not a confusing website to use. This website only has one website design and is not user friendly.</p>
