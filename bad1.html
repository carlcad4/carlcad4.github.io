  <h4>Gun Dog Supply</h4>
  <div class="box">
    <p>The first website, I dislike is the Gun Dog Supply. The website is designed to showcase the dog equipment from e-collars, dog tracking, collars + nameplates, dog beds, and dog vests. Although, the page has very interesting, I disklike this website because when you minimize the page to a smaller size it doesnâ€™t make it user friendly. The background is a very plan white background. All of the pages that are additionally apart of the website, also have a plan white background but it does have a great image display of the products that it sells, but there are no prices listed on them, so you have to click on the image of it to pull it up.</p>
<p>This site is different from the others because it is not organized as well as it could be. The main menu on the website is a lot nicer to see everything verses the section/column list. The arrows on the website to move from one page to the other is a very interesting setup but also very confusing which I do not like. They use various HTML elements such as: font-size, color, div, class, and many more. The navigation on the site, is very difficult. The navigation bar can be helpful; however, the other information on the home page is just posted. The website has more than one navigation bar, which I liked. Yet, it still feels impossible to find all of the information. </p>
<p> There is CSS effects on the page but only a margin, border, padding with the display height and width of just one main picture on the website. Then the images on the products are medium size. Then the CSS used are bold letters for the main section lists. I feel like there is no theme to this website other than hunting equipment, but it just seems like it has nothing going for it. One thing that makes this site different from the others are it has a lot of things on the website and the images help kinda set the mood.
